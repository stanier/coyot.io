# coyot.io

The scalable, cluster-ready server management panel.

# The "What"

What is coyot.io you ask?  Every sysadmin's dream:  a control panel for multiple systems with the ability to control every aspect of the system, from process control to one-click app installs, all within a clean, simple interface built on top of a MEAN stack and Google's Material Design rules.

# The "Why"

When I started working with servers, I found that the easiest way to manage a system at a glance without having to break out my laptop and ssh in was to use a control panel.  Much to my disappointment though, the existing control panels at the time were all based off legacy concepts and technologies and were often not only hard to configure, but also hard to use for certain operations.

A couple years later, we still haven't evolved much in the way of control panels.  Services such as AWS OpWorks and Bitnami offer easy management, but at a cost, and with limits.  Panels like Ajenti get closer to what we need, but not quite.

# The "Who"

Currently the project is maintained solely by Keyton Stanier, a simple 17 y/o who likes to mash keys and play with pretty lights and flying things as a hobby.  Hopely there will be more people listed here in the future.  Hopefully...
