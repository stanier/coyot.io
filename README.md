# coyot.io

The scalable, cluster-ready server management panel.

### The "What"

What is coyot.io you ask?  Every system admin's dream:  a control panel built for flexibility and scaling, leveraging the power of a MEAN stack and the elegance of Material Design.

### The "Why"

When I first started servers, I found that the best way to manage the system was to SSH in and do everything by hand.  Few control panels offered the flexibility and automation to make a difference for system admins and IT teams.

A couple years later, we still haven't evolved much in the way of control panels.  Services such as AWS OpWorks and Bitnami offer quick, flexible management, but at a cost and with limits.  Panels like Ajenti get closer to achieving what we need, but still fall short.

### The "Who"

If you really care to know who is crazy enough to start this, the name is Keyton Stanier, a 17 y/o with a passion for the evolving digital world.
